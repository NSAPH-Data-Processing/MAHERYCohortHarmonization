In this notebook we're tackling the health data from the cohort 2018 opensrp file. We decided to
leave this to a separate processing step because the health data is a bit more complex than the household registration and demographic data.

Let's begin:

## Reading in the data

The data is read in from the targets pipeline, and is contained in the `opensrp` object.
```{r}
open_census <- opensrp$`Open census`

head(open_census)
```


In this _specific case_, the raw data in the open census file is the same number of rows as the
processed targets output, so I'm going to join the raw data to the health columns.
```{r}
open_census %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  # remove this individual as they are specifically excluded from the cohort as a duplicate
  filter(!str_detect(member, "36841201")) %>%
  select(prior_health_care:deathyear) %>%
  bind_cols(select(cohort_2018_deid, uuid_clean = uuid, sex_clean = sex, age_group_clean = age_group), .) -> health_data
```


Now let's take a look at the data:
```{r}
skimr::skim(health_data)
```


## Health Care Access & Diagnoses

The first thing to determine is whether `prior_health_care` refers to,
"does this person have a history of a health care condition," or something else.
```{r}
health_data %>%
  select(prior_health_care, prior_diagnosis) %>%
  table()
```


From this it would appear that prior healthcare is a yes/no question
that tells us if they have any history of health care conditions.
```{r}
health_data %>%
  mutate(prior_health_condition_clean = case_when(
    prior_health_care == "Yes" ~ "Yes",
    !is.na(prior_diagnosis) ~ "Yes",
    TRUE ~ "No"
  )) -> health_data_
```


Now let's look at the `prior_diagnosis` column:
```{r}
health_data_ %>%
  select(prior_diagnosis) %>%
  table()
```


```{r}
health_data_ %>%
  select(other_prior_diagnosis) %>%
  table()
```


In the secondary column, we see many values that are translated. We'll translate
these manually and then cast them width wise to create a wide format table.

First, we mutate the `prior_diagnosis` column to make sure a diagnosis is one word, or clearly separated by a comma:
```{r}
health_data_ %>%
  mutate(
    prior_diagnosis_ =
      prior_diagnosis %>%
        str_to_lower() %>%
        str_replace("infected wound prior diagnosis other", "infected_wound") %>%
        str_replace("malaria cancer", "malaria,cancer") %>%
        str_replace("malaria prior diagnosis other", "malaria") %>%
        str_replace("no pregnancy prior diagnosis other", "no_pregnancy") %>%
        str_replace("no pregnancy", "no_pregnancy") %>%
        str_replace("prior diagnosis other", "other") %>%
        str_replace("hypertension idr", "hypertension") %>%
        str_replace("no diagnosis", NA_character_) %>%
        str_replace("idr", NA_character_)
  ) %>%
  select(prior_diagnosis_) %>%
  table()
```


Then, we concatenate the `prior_diagnosis` and `other_prior_diagnosis` columns to create a single diagnosis column separated by commas:
```{r}
health_data_ %>%
  mutate(
    prior_diagnosis_ =
      prior_diagnosis %>%
        str_to_lower() %>%
        str_replace("infected wound prior diagnosis other", "infected_wound") %>%
        str_replace("malaria cancer", "malaria,cancer") %>%
        str_replace("malaria prior diagnosis other", "malaria") %>%
        str_replace("no pregnancy prior diagnosis other", "no_pregnancy") %>%
        str_replace("no pregnancy", "no_pregnancy") %>%
        str_replace("prior diagnosis other", "other") %>%
        str_replace("hypertension idr", "hypertension") %>%
        str_replace("no diagnosis", NA_character_) %>%
        str_replace("idr", NA_character_)
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    other_prior_diagnosis =
      other_prior_diagnosis %>%
        str_to_lower() %>%
        str_replace("infected wound prior diagnosis other", "infected_wound") %>%
        str_replace("malaria cancer", "malaria,cancer") %>%
        str_replace("malaria prior diagnosis other", "malaria") %>%
        str_replace("no pregnancy prior diagnosis other", "no_pregnancy") %>%
        str_replace("no pregnancy", "no_pregnancy") %>%
        str_replace("prior diagnosis other", "other") %>%
        str_replace("hypertension idr", "hypertension") %>%
        str_replace("no diagnosis", NA_character_) %>%
        str_replace("idr", NA_character_)
  ) %>%
  unite(diagnoses_all, prior_diagnosis_, other_prior_diagnosis, sep = ",", remove = FALSE, na.rm = TRUE) %>%
  mutate(
    diagnoses_all =
      str_squish(diagnoses_all) %>%
        str_replace(", ", ",") %>%
        str_replace(" ", "_") %>%
        # if it just starts with "other," it means it has only "other diagnosis"
        # and can be safely removed
        str_replace("^other,", "") %>%
        # which means the ones that are 999 are true "other" diagnoses
        # with no specification in english
        str_replace("999", "other_unspecified")
  ) %>%
  mutate(diagnoses_all = na_if(diagnoses_all, "")) %>%
  select(diagnoses_all) %>%
  table()
```


Now we have a single column with all diagnoses separated by a comma. We can
use this to create a wide format table with each diagnosis as a column.

These values can then be translated and categorised into ICD10 categories, which might be useful
for cross-cultural comparisons and publications.
    
```{r malagasy_diagnosis_lookup_table}
malagasy_diagnosis_lookup_table <- tibble::tribble(
  ~raw, ~diagnosis_english, ~icd10_code, ~icd10_description,
  "aretim_bavony", "stomach_ache", "R10–R19", "Symptoms and signs involving the digestive system and abdomen",

)
# Save to package
usethis::use_data(malagasy_diagnosis_lookup_table, overwrite = TRUE)
```


You can examine this lookup table in the vignette [`Pipeline Outputs`](OutputTables.html).
  
With that, we can implement it in the function:
  
  
```{r example-create_health_diagnoses}
health_data_ %>%
  create_health_diagnoses() -> health_data_

health_data_ %>%
  summary()
```

  

## Vaccinations

We're going to categorize the vaccinations next:
```{r}
health_data_ %>% select(vaccine_card, vaccination_history) %>% table()
```


It looks like for the most part, when people have a vaccination card they have a history and can remember
which vaccinations they have had. I'm assuming Idk refers to folks who do not know _where_ their vaccination card
is, because these people can still confidently answer that they have had a specific vaccine.

For the folks who say No, it must mean that they do not have a vaccination card. However, there are some cases 
where people have a vaccination card but can say what vaccinations they have. Further, some can claim to have other
vaccinations besides those listed in the survey. 
```{r}
health_data_ %>% select(vaccine_card, vaccine_other) %>% table()
```


We can ignore this column as it is effectively the same as the vaccine history column. 
    
  
  
```{r example-clean_2018_vaccinations}
health_data_ %>%
  clean_2018_vaccinations() -> health_data_
  
health_data_ %>%
  select(contains("vacc_")) %>%
  skimr::skim()
```

  
  
## Pregnancy

Next, pregnancy:
```{r}
health_data_ %>%
  select(contains("preg")) %>%
  table()
```


This will be fairly simple and we will just create a column that indicates whether the person
is currently pregnant or not, and how many pregnancies they've had in the past.
```{r}
health_data_ %>%
  select(number_deliveries, number_live_births) %>%
  table()
```


```{r}
health_data_ %>%
  select(birthweight, birthweight_gram) %>%
  mutate(across(everything(), as.numeric)) %>%
  summary()
```


There's not much to go off of here, but I'm assuming `birthweight_gram` is the weight of the most recent child.
    
  
  
```{r example-clean_2018_pregnancy}
health_data_ %>% 
  clean_2018_pregnancy() -> health_data_

health_data_ %>%
  select(matches("pregnancy|birth|deliveries")) %>%
  select(contains("clean")) %>%
  skimr::skim()
```

  

## Other

There is no data in the columns dealing with deceased survey participants but we'll keep them
in for future comparison.

Looking at the surgical history:
```{r}
health_data %>%
  select(contains("surgeries")) %>%
  table()
```


These will likely need a deliberate translation.

Lastly, deformities will also get a translation:
```{r}
health_data %>%
  select(contains("deformit")) %>%
  table()
```


# preprocess_2018_health

The final function will combine all of these steps into a single function that can be used to preprocess the 2018 health data in the pipeline.


```{r examples-preprocess_2018_health}
preprocess_2018_health(open_census, cohort_2018_deid) -> health_data_

skim(health_data_)
```
