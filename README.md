# MAHERYCohortHarmonization

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The Madagascar Health and Environmental Research (MAHERY) cohort
datasets provide a detailed and interdisciplinary understanding of the
relationships between environmental changes, resource use, and human
health in Madagascar. These datasets encompass multiple research
initiatives, including the Northeast, Antongil, HIARA, and
cross-sectional studies, each addressing unique aspects of health and
environmental interactions.

- **Northeast Dataset**: This dataset focuses on communities near
  Maroantsetra in northeastern Madagascar, where local populations
  heavily rely on wild foods for nutrition. The study examines the
  impact of deforestation, biodiversity loss, and hunting on dietary
  intake, nutritional status, and health outcomes. It includes data on
  dietary diversity, disease metrics, and environmental resource
  use\[2\]\[3\].

- **Antongil Dataset**: Established in 2015 along Antongil Bay, this
  dataset evaluates the nutritional value of seafood and the effects of
  different fisheries governance models—traditional management,
  co-management, and marine national parks—on fish catch, seafood
  consumption, and nutritional outcomes. It includes data from 225
  households across five communities\[4\].

- **HIARA Dataset**: Initiated in 2022 in southwestern Madagascar’s Bay
  of Ranobe, this study investigates the impacts of artificial coral
  reef development on fish biomass, fisher livelihoods, nutrition, and
  mental health. It involves longitudinal monitoring of ecological and
  social systems across 14 communities\[1\].

- **Cross-Sectional Studies**: These studies provide snapshots of
  dietary patterns, nutritional status, and socio-economic indicators
  across various regions. They complement the longitudinal datasets by
  offering broader demographic insights\[2\]\[5\].

Together, these datasets form a comprehensive resource for understanding
how environmental changes influence health outcomes in vulnerable
populations.

This package establishes a pipeline that harmonizes the MAHERY cohort
data across disparate sources and produces a dataset that defines the
MAHERY Cohort for future studies.

## Approach

We will use the following steps to harmonize the MAHERY cohort data:

1.  A comprehensive review of the MAHERY cohort datasets to identify
    common variables and data structures.
2.  Secure identification and procurement of google drive credentials
    and locations (URLS) of each dataset.
3.  Data extraction and cleaning to ensure consistency and compatibility
    across datasets.
4.  Data integration to merge the datasets into a single, harmonized
    dataset.
5.  Data validation to ensure the harmonized dataset is accurate and
    reliable.
6.  Data export to save the harmonized dataset for future studies.

## Installation

You can install the development version of MAHERYCohortHarmonization
like so:

``` r
# FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE?
```

## Pipeline

The pipeline is managed by `targets`, which is a powerful R package for
reproducible data analysis. It allows you to define a series of steps
(or targets) that will be executed in order, ensuring that your analysis
is reproducible and efficient. The pipeline is deefined in the
`_targets.R` file. The functions we create to build this pipeline are
defined in the notebooks in the `dev/` directory, and exported to the
`R` directory using `fusen`.

You can run the pipeline using the following command:

``` r
library(targets)

tar_make()
```

Here is the current state of the pipeline:

# Optional: filter out internal targets like `.Random.seed`
vertices <- network$vertices %>% filter(!grepl("^\\.", name))

# Build node declarations
node_lines <- sprintf('  "%s";', vertices$name)

# Filter edges to match cleaned nodes
edges <- network$edges %>%
  filter(from %in% vertices$name, to %in% vertices$name)

# Build edge connections
edge_lines <- sprintf('  "%s" -> "%s";', edges$from, edges$to)

# Assemble DOT graph string
dot_code <- c("digraph targets_pipeline {", node_lines, edge_lines, "}")
dot_string <- paste(dot_code, collapse = "\n")

# Create grViz graph
graph <- grViz(dot_string)

svg_path <- "man/figures/pipeline_dag.svg"
svg_string <- export_svg(graph)
writeLines(svg_string, svg_path)
```
