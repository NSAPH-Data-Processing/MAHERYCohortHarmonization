\title{Recode and order education levels from OpenSRP data}
\usage{
recode_opensrp_education(df)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame that includes a column named \code{education}, containing
raw education labels such as \code{"Epp"}, \code{"Ceg"}, \code{"Lycee"}, \code{"University"}, or \code{"None"}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with two additional columns:
\describe{
\item{education_level}{A character vector with recoded education categories.}
\item{education_level_clean}{An ordered factor with levels:
\code{"no_formal_education"} < \code{"primary"} < \code{"lower_secondary"} <
\code{"upper_secondary"} < \code{"higher_education"}.}
}
}
\description{
This function recodes raw education responses from OpenSRP datasets into
standardized, English-labeled education levels. It also converts the result
into an ordered factor reflecting increasing levels of formal education.
}
\details{
The recoding is based on the following mapping:
\tabular{ll}{
"Epp"       \tab "primary"\cr
"Ceg"       \tab "lower_secondary"\cr
"Lycee"     \tab "upper_secondary"\cr
"University"\tab "higher_education"\cr
"None"      \tab "no_formal_education"
}
}
