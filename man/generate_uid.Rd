\title{Generate a short, deterministic unique identifier}
\usage{
generate_uid(salt = "cohort_secret", ..., nchar = 6)
}
\arguments{
\item{salt}{A character string used as the base salt for hashing. Defaults to \code{"cohort_secret"}.}

\item{...}{Additional values to be combined with the salt to generate the UID.
Typically, these might include identifiers such as names, dates, or other stable fields.}

\item{nchar}{Integer specifying the number of characters to return from the hashed result.
Default is 6.}
}
\value{
A character string representing a short, deterministic unique identifier.
}
\description{
This function creates a short hash-based unique identifier (UID) by combining a salt and
any number of additional inputs. It is useful for generating reproducible IDs in a pipeline,
especially when the same inputs should always result in the same UID.
}
\details{
The function uses the SHA-256 hash algorithm (via the \code{digest} package) and truncates
the result to the desired number of characters. The UID is deterministic: the same inputs
will always produce the same output.
}
\examples{
generate_uid(salt = "cohort_secret", "John", "Doe", "1990-01-01")
}
